    <h1>Selection Sort</h1>
    <p>
      Selection Sort is another simple sorting algorithm that divides the input
      list into two parts: the sorted part, which starts as an empty list, and
      the unsorted part. The Algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or
      largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsortedpart and
      swaps it with the first unsorted element. The sorted part grows, and the
      usorted part shrinks until the entire list is sorted.
    </p>
    <p>Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Selection Sort algorithm:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Assume the first element is the minimum (or maximum, depending on
        sorting order)
      </li>
      <li>
        Iterate through the unsorted part of the list to find the actual minimum
        (or maximum) element
      </li>
      <li>
        Swap the found minimum (or maximum) element with the first element of
        the unsorted part.
      </li>
      <li>
        Expand the sorted part by one element and reduce the unsorted part by
        one element.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat steps 1-4 until list is sorted</li>
    </ol>
